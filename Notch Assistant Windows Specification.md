# Alfred for Windows — Technical Specification (draft)

Sep 26, 2026 · draft for review · companion to [Notch Assistant Technical Specification.md](Notch%20Assistant%20Technical%20Specification.md)

## 1. Overview and goals

A Windows edition of Alfred, the voice assistant built for the MacBook notch. The user says "Alfred, …" (or holds a hotkey). A **local** language model turns the words into a plan, and the plan runs as tool calls on the PC. The first target machine is an **HP Omen 16**.

This is a new application, not a port. The Mac app is Swift and uses macOS frameworks throughout, none of which exist on Windows. What carries over:

- **The architecture:** activation → speech → planning → tools → presentation, with one coordinator.
- **The safety rules:** §11 lists them unchanged.
- **The deterministic layers:**
  - the command phrases matched without the model;
  - the time and duration parsers;
  - grounding (arguments must have been said);
  - the file token and undo-journal design.

  The Mac test tables are the acceptance tests for these (§12).
- **The integrations that are already cross-platform:** the Spotify Web API, Google Calendar, Microsoft Graph, Open-Meteo weather, Kokoro TTS and openWakeWord.

### The offline premise, unchanged

No cloud AI. Understanding happens on the PC; only actions that need the internet use it (weather, web search, Spotify search, calendars).

### Goals

1. **Free.** Every dependency free and open source. No API keys that cost money.
2. **Fast on this laptop.** Less than 1.5 s from the end of speech to the start of an action for common commands.
3. **Light when idle.** The wake word is the only always-on cost. The model and the voice load on demand and unload when idle.
4. **Same assistant.** The same commands, name, confirmation and undo behaviour, and the same refusals as the Mac app.
5. **Easy to hand over.** A single installer the friend can run without developer tools.

### Non-goals (first release)

- A notch. Windows laptops have none; §5 describes the replacement.
- Apple-only features: WeatherKit, Apple Calendar, Reminders, Shortcuts and AppleScript are replaced or dropped (§8).
- A Microsoft Store listing, and gestures. Both are possible later (§10).

## 2. Target machine

HP Omen 16 variants from 2023 to 2025. The friend should confirm the exact one: Task Manager → Performance → GPU shows "Dedicated GPU memory".

| Part | Range | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | Intel Core i7-13700HX to i9-14900HX, or AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS / 8040-series | Fine for the CPU fallback. The AMD 8040 NPU (about 16 TOPS) is below Copilot+ (40 TOPS), so **Windows AI APIs / Phi Silica are not available**. |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4050 (6 GB) to RTX 4060/4070 (8 GB) to RTX 5070 Ti (12 GB) | **The main accelerator.** CUDA runs the language model, Whisper and Kokoro far faster than the Mac's CPU/ANE paths. |
| RAM | 16–32 GB | Budget ≤ 3 GB of system RAM for the app; models live in VRAM. |
| Display | 16.1" internal; often an external monitor | The overlay is pinned to the internal display, as on the Mac (§5). |
| Power | Gaming laptop with fans; weak battery life on the dGPU | Plugged in: GPU path. Battery: CPU path, smaller models, wake word off by default (§9). |
| OS | Windows 11 23H2 or later | Required for the toast, audio and UI Automation APIs used. |

Unlike the fanless M4 Air, heat is not the ceiling; **battery and GPU switching are**. With Optimus the NVIDIA GPU sleeps when idle and wakes in about 0.5 s. That is acceptable, but the model should stay resident while plugged in (§9).

## 3. Technology choices

| Concern | Choice | Why | Alternatives considered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Language / runtime | **C# on .NET 9** | First-class Windows APIs (Win32, WinRT, UI Automation, Core Audio); one language for everything; good native interop for llama.cpp and Whisper | Rust + Tauri (smaller, but weaker UI Automation and COM interop); Python (packaging and startup cost) |
| UI | **WPF** | Borderless, transparent, topmost overlay windows are simple and reliable; mature tray-icon libraries | WinUI 3 (modern look, but custom transparent overlay windows are awkward) |
| Tray icon | H.NotifyIcon (MIT) | The equivalent of the Mac menu bar item | — |
| Language model runtime | **llama.cpp via LLamaSharp (MIT)**, CUDA backend, CPU fallback | In-process (no local server); **grammar-constrained JSON output**, the equivalent of the Mac's `@Generable` structured output | Ollama (a separate service to install); ONNX Runtime GenAI with DirectML (vendor-neutral, weaker constrained decoding) |
| Model | **A 4B-class instruct model, Q4_K_M GGUF** (Qwen3-4B, Gemma 3 4B or Phi-4-mini, chosen by the intent test corpus, §12); an 8B class model optional on 8 GB+ cards | A 4B model at Q4 is about 2.5–3 GB of VRAM, leaving room for Whisper and Kokoro on a 6 GB card, and is stronger than the Mac's 3B | 7–8B as default (better, but tight on 6 GB, and slower on the CPU fallback) |
| Speech to text | **whisper.cpp via Whisper.net (MIT)**, `small.en` on GPU, `base.en` on CPU | Accurate on accents; on GPU a 3 s command transcribes in about 0.3 s | Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition (on-device and streaming, but noticeably less accurate) |
| End of speech | **Silero VAD (MIT, ONNX)** | Reliable end-of-speech detection in noisy rooms; also gates the wake word | Energy threshold (the Mac's `Endpointer`), kept as the fallback |
| Wake word | **VAD-gated keyword check**: Silero VAD finds speech, then Whisper `tiny.en` checks the segment for "Alfred" | The same idea as the Mac's speech-recogniser wake word, which beat a trained openWakeWord model on the owner's voice; no training needed; it runs only while someone is talking | openWakeWord with a custom "alfred" model (training failed on the Mac); Porcupine (proprietary) |
| Text to speech | **Windows OneCore voices** by default; **Kokoro-82M** optional (ONNX Runtime + DirectML/CUDA) | OneCore voices need nothing extra. Kokoro is the natural voice from the Mac app | Piper (lighter, less natural) |
| Audio | NAudio (MIT): capture at 16 kHz mono, ducking via Core Audio session volumes | Ducking lowers *other apps' sessions*, not the master volume. That is better than the Mac, which had to lower the master volume | — |
| Packaging | **Inno Setup installer** (unsigned at first), later signed with **Azure Trusted Signing** | One `.exe` for the friend; SmartScreen warns until it is signed | MSIX (self-signed certificates are awkward to trust on another PC) |

**Kokoro phonemisation needs care.** Kokoro needs text converted to phonemes. The usual converter, espeak-ng, is **GPL-3.0**. Shipping it inside a closed installer has licence implications, while running it as a separate, unmodified process with its source offered is the common approach. The alternative is a non-GPL grapheme-to-phoneme model, as FluidAudio uses on the Mac. This is decided before W4 (§13). Either way, reuse the Mac's `SpeechText.forNeuralVoice` rewriting, which turns "07:00" into "7 A M" and similar, because Kokoro misreads clock times on any platform.

## 4. Architecture

The same five layers and single coordinator as the Mac spec, as C# interfaces:

| Layer | Interface | Windows implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation | `IActivationSource` | `HotkeyActivation` (RegisterHotKey, hold-to-talk via a low-level keyboard hook), `WakeWordListener` |
| Speech | `ITranscriptionService` | `WhisperTranscriber` + `SileroEndpointer` |
| Intelligence | `IAssistantEngine` | `LocalModelEngine`: routines → small talk → `DirectMatcher` → `ToolRouter` → constrained model call |
| Action | `IAssistantTool` | One class per tool (§8) |
| Presentation | `IPresenter` | `OverlayWindow` (WPF) + `Speaker` |

The **coordinator** is a single-threaded async state machine (one `SemaphoreSlim`-guarded loop). It has the same ten states as the Mac: Idle, Listening, Thinking, Acting, Result, Reply, List, Confirm, Alert and Error, with the same dismissal timings.

**The model is never given a shell.** The rules of §11 apply to every tool.

### The planning pipeline

Unchanged from the Mac, because it is what made the small model reliable:

1. **Clean** the transcript.
2. **Routines**, matched on the user's phrases.
3. **Small talk and refusals** (for example, requests to read file contents).
4. **`DirectMatcher`:** each tool's fixed phrasings, with no model call. "and"/"then" commands go to the model, except durations such as "an hour and a half", listed weekdays, and reminders.
5. **`ToolRouter`:** show the model at most 4 tools, chosen by keyword.
6. **Constrained generation:**
   - A JSON schema, `{"steps": [ {tool, arguments} … ]}`, where each step is one of the routed tools' argument schemas, compiled to a llama.cpp grammar.
   - A context of 4,096 tokens and a prompt under about 2,500 tokens.
   - A 10 s timeout.
7. **Grounding in each tool:** an argument must have been said, or must mean the same as something said (the Mac's multi-step rule). Values that don't check out are refused, not guessed.

A plan is executed step by step. A failing step stops the rest, except in routines, which run every step and report failures at the end.

## 5. Presentation: the overlay pill

Windows has no notch, so Alfred appears as a **pill at the top centre of the internal display**, just below the top edge. It keeps the Mac design's states and sizes.

- **Window:**
  - Borderless and transparent.
  - `Topmost`, `ShowActivated=false` and `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`, so it never takes focus from the user's app.
  - `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`, so it stays out of Alt+Tab.
  - Click-through (`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`) except while it shows buttons.
- **Placement:** the internal panel is found with `QueryDisplayConfig`, where the output technology is internal/embedded. Never "the primary monitor", which is the Windows version of the Mac's `NSScreen.main` bug.
- **Display changes:** re-resolve on `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE`, debounced by 300 ms.
- **Lid closed with an external monitor:** Hide, Floating (top of the primary monitor) or Disable, as on the Mac.
- **Full-screen games and video:** the pill does not appear over exclusive-fullscreen apps. Results are then spoken, as in the Mac's Hide mode.
- **Idle:** hidden. The one exception is a running timer or stopwatch, which shows a small countdown pill (as on the Mac), expanding on hover to list the timers.
- **Escape** cancels from any non-idle state. A global key registration is active only while the pill is visible.

**Tray menu:** status, running timers, alarms and the stopwatch with their controls, Pause Listening (kill switch), Settings and Quit.

**Settings window (WPF):** Activation, Model & Voice, Capabilities (a generated toggle per tool), Routines, Clock, Calendar, Files, Spotify, Permissions & Privacy, and Display. It mirrors the Mac panes.

## 6. Activation and speech

- **Hotkey:** hold-to-talk. The Mac uses ⌥Space, but Alt+Space opens the window menu on Windows, so the default is **Ctrl+Alt+Space**, and it can be rebound.
- **Wake word:**
  - Silero VAD runs continuously on 30 ms frames, at about 1% of one CPU core.
  - When VAD detects speech, the segment (including a 2.5 s pre-roll ring buffer) goes to Whisper `tiny.en` with the initial prompt "Alfred".
  - It triggers if the text contains "Alfred" (any prefix: "hey", "okay", "good morning").
  - A command in the same breath ("Alfred, open Spotify") is taken from that segment directly.
  - Detections are de-duplicated by audio time, as on the Mac.
- **End of speech:** 0.8 s of VAD silence, a 10 s cap, and 2 s with no speech at all returns to Idle.
- **Ducking:** while listening, lower other apps' audio sessions to 30% through `IAudioSessionManager2`, and restore them afterwards. Restoring is crash-safe: the previous volumes are saved to disk first.
- **Speaking:** the same Always / Errors only / Never setting. Answers (weather, clock, calendar) are always spoken unless set to Never.

## 7. Intelligence: model management

- **First run:**
  - Settings offers to download the model (about 2.5 GB for 4B Q4) and Whisper `small.en` (about 470 MB) from Hugging Face, with progress and a checksum check.
  - Nothing downloads without the user clicking.
- **Placement:** a GPU is used if CUDA is available with ≥ 4 GB free VRAM; otherwise the CPU (4B Q4 runs at about 10–20 tokens/s there, so plans take 2–4 s).
- **Staying loaded:**
  - Plugged in: the model stays loaded.
  - On battery: it unloads after 2 idle minutes.
  - Whisper `tiny` (the wake word) always stays loaded while the wake word is on.
- **Model choice:** Settings lists 4B (default) and 8B (8 GB+ VRAM). The final default is whichever scores best on the intent corpus (§12). Model swaps need no code change.
- **Unavailable model:** a clear error with a link to Settings → Model, never a crash.

## 8. Tool catalog

Mac tools and their Windows implementations. "Same" means the same arguments, direct phrasings and grounding rules as the Mac tool.

| Tool | Windows implementation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openApp` | Start menu apps: `.lnk` files in both Start Menu folders plus packaged apps (`PackageManager`), matched with the Mac's `AppNameMatcher` rules; launched via `ShellExecute` | Same aliases ("vs code" → Visual Studio Code) |
| `openURL` | `ShellExecute` (default browser) or the named browser's exe (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Arc for Windows) | Same URL grounding |
| `webSearch` | Search URL, as on the Mac | Same |
| `playYouTube` | Tier 1: YouTube results URL. Tier 2 (opt-in): UI Automation in Chrome/Edge to open the first real video | Chrome and Edge expose their page to UI Automation, but this is brittle, as on the Mac; it always falls back to Tier 1 |
| `controlSpotify` | Play/pause/next/previous: **System Media Transport Controls** (`GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager`), which works for Spotify and any media app with no account. Songs and playlists: **Spotify Web API** (the user's own client ID, PKCE, loopback), then start playback through the Web API | Web API playback control needs **Spotify Premium**; without it, fall back to opening `spotify:track:…` in the app |
| `systemControl` | Volume/mute: Core Audio endpoint volume. Brightness: WMI `WmiMonitorBrightnessMethods` (internal panel). Lock: `LockWorkStation`. Sleep: `SetSuspendState` | **Do Not Disturb has no public API on Windows 11**: open Settings › Notifications instead and say so |
| `getWeather` | Open-Meteo only | No WeatherKit |
| `findFiles` / `openFile` | **Windows Search index** via the `SystemIndex` OLE DB provider, **metadata columns only** (name, kind, dates); results as tokens | Content columns (`System.Search.Contents`) are never queried, matching the Mac's no-contents rule |
| `organiseFiles` / `undoFileChange` | `IFileOperation`: rename, move, copy and **Recycle Bin only** (`FOFX_RECYCLEONDELETE`), with the same write-ahead journal and undo | Same scoped roots (Documents, Downloads, Desktop), deny list and batch ≤ 20 with confirmation |
| `timer`, `alarm`, `stopwatch` | In-app scheduler, as on the Mac, plus **scheduled toast notifications** (`ScheduledToastNotification`) as the backup when the app isn't running | Windows can deliver scheduled toasts with the app closed, which is better than the Mac |
| `reminder` | **Microsoft To Do** (Graph `Tasks.ReadWrite`) or **Google Tasks**, whichever calendar account is connected; otherwise an in-app reminder with a scheduled toast | No Apple Reminders |
| `currentTime` | Same | Time zones via `TimeZoneInfo` plus Open-Meteo geocoding |
| `calendar` | **Outlook** (Microsoft Graph) or **Google Calendar**, one at a time, **read-only** | No local calendar store with a public API on Windows |
| `runShortcut` | **Dropped.** Replaced by a routine step "run program or script the user chose" only if §11 allows it (it does not by default), or Home Assistant / smart-home webhooks later | Lights on the Mac came through Apple Shortcuts/HomeKit |
| `arrangeWindow` | `SetWindowPos` on the foreground window (or the named app's main window) within the monitor's work area; `ShowWindow` for minimise/maximise | The frame maths from the Mac `WindowLayout` carries over |
| `clipboard` | Win32 clipboard; skip items marked `ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing` or `CanIncludeInClipboardHistory = 0` (the password-manager convention on Windows); paste via `SendInput` Ctrl+V | Same "never read secrets aloud" rule |
| `takeNote` | Append to **OneNote** (Graph) if connected, else a Markdown file in Documents\Alfred Notes | No Apple Notes |
| Routines | Same model and editor; the steps are the tools above | "Lights" steps need a smart-home integration (future) |

## 9. Power profiles

| Feature | Plugged in | On battery | Battery saver |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hotkey | On | On | On |
| Wake word | On if enabled | Off by default (setting) | Off |
| Model | GPU, kept loaded | CPU or GPU per setting, unloaded after 2 min idle | CPU, unloaded after use |
| Whisper | `small.en` on GPU | `base.en` on CPU | `base.en` on CPU |
| Kokoro | GPU | CPU (slower) or OneCore voice | OneCore voice |

Signals: `PowerManager.PowerSupplyStatus`, `PowerManager.EnergySaverStatus`, and the NVIDIA GPU's availability, which is re-checked on each load.

## 10. Phases

Each phase is usable on its own. The friend tests every phase on the Omen.

| Phase | Contents | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **W0: prove the loop** | Hotkey → Whisper → `DirectMatcher` + local model (constrained JSON) → `openApp`, `openURL`; console output | "open Spotify" and "open YouTube" work from a cold start in < 2 s on the GPU |
| **W1: the pill** | Overlay window, state machine, tray, Settings (Capabilities, Permissions, Model with downloads), `webSearch`, `getWeather`, `currentTime` | All states render on the internal display, and an external monitor doesn't move the pill |
| **W2: hands-free** | Wake word, VAD endpointing, ducking, OneCore TTS, `controlSpotify`, `systemControl`, file search/open, power profiles | "Alfred, play some music" works across a day with < 2 false wakes |
| **W3: daily use** | Clock tools with toasts, calendar (Outlook/Google), reminders, routines, `arrangeWindow`, `clipboard`, `takeNote` | The Mac clock and calendar test tables pass; an alarm rings with the app closed (toast) |
| **W4: the rest** | File organising with undo, YouTube Tier 2, Kokoro voice, installer signing | Rename then "undo that" restores; the installer runs on a clean Windows install |
| Later | Gestures (camera + MediaPipe hand landmarks via ONNX), smart-home lights, Microsoft Store | — |

## 11. Invariants (unchanged from the Mac spec, plus Windows specifics)

- No `runCommand` tool; the model never reaches `cmd`, PowerShell, `wscript`, `rundll32` or any script host.
- No tool reads or edits file contents. Search uses metadata columns only.
- No permanent deletion: the Recycle Bin only, and the agent cannot empty it.
- The model receives file tokens, never paths. Every file change is journalled before acting, and existing files are never overwritten.
- Arguments must have been said (grounding).
- Capability toggles gate registration with the model, not just the UI.
- The calendar is read-only.
- **Windows specifics:**
  - The app never requests elevation (no admin, no UIAccess) and never writes outside its own folders or the file roots.
  - Model files are verified by SHA-256 before loading.
  - OAuth tokens go in the Windows Credential Manager (`CredWrite`), never in settings files.
  - The loopback sign-in listener binds 127.0.0.1/::1 only.

## 12. Development and testing

- **Where it's built:**
  - Code can be written from the Mac.
  - WPF, CUDA and the Windows APIs need Windows to build and run. Plain .NET class libraries (the parsers and matchers) build and test on the Mac with `dotnet test`.
  - Windows 11 on Arm in a VM on the M4 Mac can test the UI and the CPU paths, but **not CUDA**.
  - GPU testing happens on the Omen.
- **Shared tests:** export the Mac's test tables (direct phrasings, time and duration parsing, grounding, routine matching, clock multi-step cases, `SpeechText`) to `shared/fixtures/*.json`. Both apps run them. This keeps the Windows behaviour identical and catches drift.
- **Intent corpus:** the Mac's `Tests/Fixtures/intents.txt` is run against each candidate model to choose the default (§3), and re-run whenever the prompt, the tools or the model change.
- **Manual checklist:**
  - external monitor attached and removed;
  - lid closed;
  - full-screen game;
  - unplug mid-command;
  - no internet;
  - no GPU (driver disabled);
  - a password manager item on the clipboard;
  - a rename then "undo that";
  - an alarm with the app closed.

**Repository.** A `windows/` folder in this repo (`Alfred.sln`), sharing `shared/fixtures` and the specs. It is released separately from the Mac app.

## 13. Open decisions

1. **Which Omen exactly** (VRAM 6 vs 8 GB+): this decides whether an 8B model is offered.
2. **Default model**, decided by the intent corpus between the 4B candidates.
3. **Kokoro phonemisation** (§3): espeak-ng as a separate GPL process, or a non-GPL G2P model.
4. **Lights and smart home:** Home Assistant webhooks, Philips Hue, or none for now.
5. **Signing:** Azure Trusted Signing (about US$10/month) before sharing more widely; unsigned is acceptable for one friend, who clicks through SmartScreen once.
6. **Spotify without Premium:** transport controls work through Windows media controls, but "play <song>" needs Premium for Web API playback.
